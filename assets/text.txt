[0:00] Part1
Beneath the neon cross, she prays for no light.
A vow between sinners, carved in trembling shared breath.
The stairway bleeds with desperate faith.
Salvation wears a blade tonight.

In dreams she walks, where faces blur and hum.
The silent city echoes what she’s become.
Keys unlock not doors, but thoughts undone.
Wakefulness feels stranger than the numb.

A painted world, a silent frozen scream,
Where pretty portraits haunt a waking dream.
To mend the tapestry of fractured art,
A child must play her sacrificial part.

Laughter hides where guilt is cased.
Memory blooms, then wilts in shame.
To forgive oneself—is the final game.
